# Replace Spotify: Ethical Music Streaming Research

Research and documentation for replacing Spotify with ethical, artist-friendly alternatives that align with leftist values.

## üéØ Project Goal

Find and implement music streaming/ownership solutions that:
- **Support artists fairly** (better compensation than Spotify's $0.003/stream)
- **Align with socialist values** (anti-war, pro-LGBTQI+, anti-corporate exploitation)
- **Provide technical compatibility** (iPhone, CarPlay, Sonos, WiiM Pro Plus)
- **Enable music ownership** (downloads, self-hosting, format shifting)

## üìä Key Findings
