## ‚ùå ERRORS FOUND - MUST CORRECT

### 1. Spotify Premium Pricing - WRONG
**Current Documentation Says**: $12/month AUD (appears in multiple places)
**Actual Price**: $15.99/month AUD
**Error**: Understated by $3.99/month ($47.88/year)
**Impact**: CRITICAL - affects cost comparisons

**Annual cost error**: $192 claimed, should be **$191.88** (close enough to round to $192, but monthly rate wrong)

**Where to Fix**:
- claude.md
- master-project-documentation.md
- README.md
- spotify-alternatives-report.html
- future-workflows-backlog.md

---

### 2. Qobuz Studio Pricing - INACCURATE
**Current Documentation Says**: $25-30 AUD/month
**Actual Price**: $19.99 AUD/month (or $16.66/month if paying annually at $199.90/year)
**Error**: Overstated by $5-10/month
**Impact**: HIGH - makes Qobuz seem more expensive than it is

**Annual cost implications**:
- Monthly: $19.99 √ó 12 = $239.88/year (not $300-360)
- Annual plan: $199.90/year (even cheaper)

**Where to Fix**:
- ALL documentation files
- Particularly cost comparison tables

---

### 3. Apple Music Pricing - SLIGHTLY LOW
**Current Documentation Says**: $12/month AUD
**Actual Price**: $12.99/month AUD
**Error**: Understated by $0.99/month ($11.88/year)
**Impact**: LOW - relatively minor

**Annual cost**: $12.99 √ó 12 = $155.88/year (not $144)

---

### 4. Lidarr PR #5577 Date - WRONG YEAR
**Current Documentation Says**: "Last updated Aug 2024"
**Actual Date**: August 28, **2025**
**Error**: Wrong year
**Impact**: MEDIUM - misleading about how recent the PR is

**Where to Fix**:
- lidarr-discogs-workflow.md (multiple mentions)

---

### 5. Vultr Pricing - POSSIBLY INFLATED
**Current Documentation Says**: $9 AUD/month for 1GB RAM
**Actual Price**: $3.50-5 USD/month ($5.35-7.65 AUD) for regular, $6 USD for high-frequency
**Error**: May be overstated
**Impact**: MEDIUM - makes competitor seem more expensive
**Note**: Need to verify which tier was being compared

---

### 6. Linode USD‚ÜíAUD Conversion - NEEDS VERIFICATION
**Current Documentation Says**: $7.50 AUD/month
**Actual USD Price**: $5.00 USD/month
**Current Conversion**: ~$7.65 AUD at Oct 2025 rates
**Error**: Close but may drift with exchange rates
**Impact**: LOW - very close to accurate
**Recommendation**: Note as "~$7.65 AUD (at current exchange rates)"

---
