## Data Quality Notes

### Variations in Artist Compensation Rates
**Important**: Artist compensation per stream varies significantly based on:
- Listener location (regional licensing agreements)
- Subscription type (Premium vs Free tier)
- Time period measured (rates change yearly)
- Calculation methodology (some include publisher splits, others don't)

Therefore, rates shown in documentation should be understood as **ranges** or **representative examples** rather than fixed, universal values. Where possible, we cite multiple sources and show ranges.

### VPS Pricing Currency Conversions
**Note**: VPS providers list prices in USD. AUD conversions are approximate and subject to exchange rate fluctuations. For accuracy:
- OVHcloud Australia pricing is native AUD (most reliable)
- Other providers: USD prices converted at time of access
- GST may or may not be included in displayed prices

### Spotify Helsing Investment Amount Variations
Multiple sources cite the investment as:
- €600 million (EUR)
- $694 million (USD)
- $690+ million (USD)
- ~$700 million (various currencies)

These are all the **same investment**, just reported in different currencies or with rounding.

## Citations Still Needed

The following claims in documentation still require verification:

### Audio Quality Claims
- Tidal "dropped MQA for FLAC in 2024" - date needs verification
- Apple Music "AirPlay limited to 256kbps" - needs technical documentation
- Specific catalog sizes (Spotify "~100 million" is vague)

### Corporate Ethics
- Tidal acquisition "$297M" - needs business press source
- Tidal "No Jay-Z discussion ban" - needs employee testimony/report
- DigitalOcean "200 employees = 11%" - needs press release
- Qobuz "100% COVID revenue to artists" - needs press release/timeframe
- Apple NLRB charges - needs case numbers

### Technical Compatibility
- Qobuz CarPlay "crashes" - needs user review aggregation
- Sonos "2024 app redesign issues" - needs tech press coverage
- WiiM Pro Plus specific service compatibility - needs manufacturer docs

### Legal
- Australian Copyright Act 1968 Section 43C exact text
- "Private and domestic use" legal interpretation

### Apps
- play:Sub current App Store price (claimed $15 AUD)
- CLZ Music current price (claimed ~$20)
