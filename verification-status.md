## Critical Issues Found

1. **Lidarr PR date conflict**: Documentation says "Aug 2024" but earlier WebFetch returned "Aug 2025"
2. **Spotify pricing conflict**: Some docs say $12/month, should be $15.99 for AUD Premium
3. **Vague catalog claims**: "~100+ million" is imprecise

---

## Next Steps

1. Start with VPS pricing verification (already partially done for OVHcloud)
2. Move to artist compensation rates (critical for ethics claims)
3. Verify Spotify Helsing investment (most important ethics claim)
4. Verify YouTube GLAAD scores
5. Continue through lower priority items
